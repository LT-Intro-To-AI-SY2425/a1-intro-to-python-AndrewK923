# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
It is pretty different from what I'm used to with java. Python was actually the first programming language that I fully learned before Freshman year. I haven't done any Python programming since then but I remember a lot of details, like in inclusivity thing and of course indentation. It's a lot more elegant than java. 


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Java isn't sensitive to indentation. Also just the syntax and general functions are different. Overall all progamming languages kind of try to achieve the same thing, so most concepts carry over. 



3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I just relearned syntax and some of the rules that come with progamming. I also learned how to push things to git.
